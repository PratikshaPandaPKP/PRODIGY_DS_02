1. **Data Importing**: The Titanic dataset is imported as training and testing data.

2. **Initial Exploration**: The first five rows of both the training and testing datasets are displayed to understand the structure of the data.

3. **Column Names**: Column names in the training and testing DataFrames are printed.

4. **Numerical Features**: Numerical features in the training DataFrame are extracted based on their data types, focusing on float values.

5. **Descriptive Statistics**: Descriptive statistics of numeric columns of the training DataFrame are computed to understand the distribution of data.

6. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the Age, Fare, and Embarked columns are imputed using appropriate strategies.

7. **Data Visualization**: Several visualizations are created to explore relationships between variables:
   - Distribution of survival based on gender.
   - Distribution of survival based on passenger class.
   - Survival rates based on gender and class.
   - Ages of passengers who survived and those who didn't.

Overall, the analysis provides insights into factors influencing survival on the Titanic, such as gender, passenger class, and age. These findings can inform further analysis and modeling tasks.
